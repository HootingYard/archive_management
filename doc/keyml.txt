XHTML and KeyML
---------------

The "bigbook" archive and the book sources are in KeyML format.

KeyML is a subset of XHTML that can represent any text from the Hooting Yard blog,
can be used in an EPUB, is acceptable to Kindlegen, and contains sufficient 
information for translation into LaTeX to create print books.

KeyML is defined in the XML DTD file 'keyml.dtd'. GreasePencil only accepts document
files matching this DTD. The Hooting Yard text archives should only be saved in KeyML.
(KeyML can expanded if necessary.)  The utility 'test_xhtml.py' can be used to
check that files comply with KeyML.

See:
   https://github.com/HootingYard/archive_management/blob/main/src/hootingyard/utils/keyml.dtd

Below is the KeyML subset. The indentation indicates nesting, dots indicates class. 
Note that KeyML does not allow multiple classes in a single class attribute, 
e.g. <p class="noindent center"> will be rejected.
